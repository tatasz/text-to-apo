# text-to-apo
Processing code that takes a text and produces Apophysis params with it.

Install processing (from processing.org), then place all the files (and the data folder) into a folder called "text-to-apo".
Open text-to-apo.pde, set the first 3 variables, and run it.

The output comes with no gradient, so add a gradient to make it visible.
